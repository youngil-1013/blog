Sphinx and RST 2: Deploying my Website on GitHub Pages
======================================================

Github Pages and Actions
------------------------

Right now, the "website" is just a bunch of HTML files in a directory, not accessible from the internet. To make it accessible, I will use GitHub Pages, which is linked with a GitHub repository and the service is free!
This section requires a GitHub account, which you can create at `GitHub <https:github.com>`_. If you have never authorized your computer to access GitHub, you will need to set up access tokens.
Create your access token by following the instructions at `GitHub's documentation <https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token>`_.

Now, create a new repository via GitHub, and make it public (required for GitHub Pages). You can name this repository anything you want, but because this doubles as my personal website, I name it "youngil-1013.github.io".
