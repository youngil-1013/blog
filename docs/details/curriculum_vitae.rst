  .. collapse:: Relevant Coursework

    * | **YSC4216: Machine Learning**
      | Implemented classical machine learning algorithms such as **K-means, Decision Trees, and Neural Networks** from scratch in **Python**. Utilized **TensorFlow** to build and train deep learning models.
    * | **YSC3232: Software Engineering**
      | Ideated, designed, and implemented a 2-player online game backed by **Firebase**. Leveraged **Java** programming skills in **Android Studio**.
    * | **YSC3236: Functional Programming and Proving**
      | Employed the **Coq Proof Assitant** to show completeness and soundness of specifications, derive formalized proofs for tail-recursive programs, and practiced functional programmnig techniques.
    * | **YSC4217: Mechanized Reasoning**
      | Implemented a compiler and interpreter for numerical and variable expression in **Gallina** and formally proved that interpretting the source code is equivalent to evaluating the compiled code in **Coq**.
    * | **YSC4230: Programming Language Design and Implementation**
      | Designed and implemented an interpretter, desugarer, and core language for a new programming language in **plait**. Discussed scoping, lambda calculus, and styles of programming languages.
